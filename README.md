# Trinity
With the combined efforts of a couple of developers you may or may not be familiar with resulted in the creation of this project. We'll list them all below. What I wanted was a project where people could either use a free client that is completely safe and has no communication with anyone outside themselves, or they could examine our source code and discover more about VRC Modding. If I ever quit developing for VRC, I'll do my best to keep this source updated, but I make no guarantees.

# Credit
This project's credits include both past and present developers. For this project, several of them were removed or stopped developing for TrinityClient. In any case, a big thank you to everyone who helped with this project.

# Licnese
As long as you don't propagate misinformation to trick others into purchasing our free project, I don't worry as much about the licensing.
